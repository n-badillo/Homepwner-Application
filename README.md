# Homepwner-Application
 
This program was created by following the book "iOS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide, 6th Edition."  There are variations to the code made to make sure it works on Xcode version 11.3.1 and the most current version of Swift (as of April 6th 2020).  

### About this repository
This repositoy is broken up into sections of the book, starting from Chapter 10.  Each commit is a different section that was completed how the book intended it to be completed by the end of that section - meaning that some commits _will not run_ and that it will be fixed in a future or updated commit.

I did this so that I could easily revert to a previous section if I encountered any errors (which of course happens).
